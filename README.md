CodeCraft: AI-powered Healthcare Diagnostics

CodeCraft is a project designed to revolutionize healthcare diagnoses by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our user-friendly platform analyzes vast amounts of healthcare data, empowering healthcare professionals with valuable insights to make more informed decisions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Key Features:

Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly platform featuring a streamlined design makes it easy for both patients and healthcare providers to navigate. This includes a clear home page, informative error page, forgot password functionality, secure login system, and a straightforward registration process.
Advanced AI Model: Our cutting-edge AI model is trained on extensive healthcare datasets. This allows it to identify patterns and trends that may be missed by traditional methods, leading to a deeper understanding of patient conditions.
